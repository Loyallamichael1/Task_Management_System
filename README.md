# Task Management System

A simple Python command-line application for managing tasks. It allows users to add, delete, search, and export tasks with attributes like title, description, due date, and status. Tasks can be exported to a CSV file for easy sharing and storage.

## How to Run and Test the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd task-management
   ```
   
3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python task_manager.py
   ```
   
   The program will display a menu with options to add, delete, search, or export tasks.

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to interact with the task management system.

## Features Implemented

- Add tasks with title, description, due date, and status.
- Delete tasks by title or due date.
- Search tasks by title or due date.
- Export tasks to a CSV file.
  
## Assumptions and Known Limitations

- The program doesn't validate user inputs beyond basic checks (e.g., date format is not enforced).
- Deleting tasks by due date assumes that the due date is unique, which may not always be the case.
